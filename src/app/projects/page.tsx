      Did you know that we completed our first borehole well this year? We started our WASH project in March, 2023 with
      our pilot borehole project which was a success. We completed a new borehole well in mid-May, bringing clean water
      to 2,000 families. The well is located on Chiremba Road, a densely-populated spot. School attendance rates have
      increased by 4% since the well was completed about a month ago. Clinic visits are down as well. One well has
      already made a huge impact in this community.

      We are establishing a WASH program in Epworth, a dormitory town in the Harare region. WASH stands for Global
      Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene. These community members are incredibly resilient and the city exhibits a vibrant
      culture. Will you help us bring clean water to Epworth so this community can continue to flourish? At this time,
      residents have very little access to clean water. Some residents travel up to seven hours a day to draw water.
      Many residents resort to two rivers and an inactive quarry to bathe, wash their clothes, and drink. These
      resources are contaminated and waterborne illnesses are on the rise. Residents do not have access to restrooms or
      shower facilities. They use dirt floors to use the bathroom and buckets to take showers. Dare to Share is seeking
      funds to build new restroom and shower facilities to increase the hygiene of the community. We are drilling 200
      borehole wells in addition to our restroom project. Our borehole wells and restroom facilities comprise our WASH
      program. With proper funding, we can bring clean water and hygiene facilities to Epworth in three to five years.

      Epworth is a dormitory town located in the Harare region. We are building WASH resources for this community of
      200,000 people through sustainable programs designed to involve community members. We are raising funds to build
      borehole wells and hygiene facilities to support the population&apos;s needs. Residents do not readily have access
      to restrooms or showers. They bathe in nearby rivers where the water is contaminated with waste. Help us build new
      hygiene facilities by clicking the link below.
