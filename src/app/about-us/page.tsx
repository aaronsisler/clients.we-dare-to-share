      Dare to Share was established by brothers Jonathan and Ringstone Daniel and achieved 501(c)(3) status in 2001. The
      brothers lived near Epworth by the Ruwa River when they were children. Epworth grew from a small village into a
      large settlement after Zimbabwe&apos;s independence. They watched the rural collection of houses grow into an
      informal settlement. People began to struggle because public amenities such as clean water and public facilities
      were never officially established. Jonathan Daniel and wife, Robin, started Dare to Share to give a hand to the
      less privileged such as orphans, widows, and families who struggle with food insecurity. We have supported 1,000
      families through our food insecurity program and funded the education of several children from those families.
      Dare to Share is a grassroots organization with a very small staff. Our programs have been relatively small in
      scope. Now, we are expanding our operations to tackle the larger problems that Epworth faces. A lack of clean
      water is the biggest challenge that residents deal with daily. Dare to Share is establishing a WASH project to
      fulfill this need. If you would like to learn more about our organization or support our cause, feel free to
      contact us at daretoshare.epworth@gmail.com . A team member will contact you shortly. We are open to donations and
      partnerships at this time.
